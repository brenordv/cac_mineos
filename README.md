Scripts to install MineOS on a server hosted at CloudAtCost.

Until further notice, this repository contains test scripts. I'm trying to streamline the installation process of MineOS on CAC.
It's kind of tricky, since their images a somewhat outdated/limited and none of the oficial tutorials work.

Important note: I only have access to the following tier: Legacy CloudPRO v1.

Wish me luck.
